This Directory contains the source files used to create the resources
You may need ExpressionDesign to open some of this files
And Eventually a Image Editing software to edit Images

Files in this direcotory are not compiled or included as output of compiation
the folder is included in the project just because this is 
the easiest way to put them in the SourceControl and let you know 
they are they too if you want to edit some of the resources 

Files:

Buttons.design
  used to generate \Resources\Buttons.xaml
  open it with ExpressionDesign and from file menu select Export
  use:
    Format = "XAML WPF Resource Dictionary"
	Group By = "Object"
  ...and then Export !
